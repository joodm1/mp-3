            <h1> My Job Experiences</h1>
            <p>
                Throughout my illustrious career, I have held a variety of roles that have challenged me both mentally
                and
                physically. Here’s a look at some of the jobs that have helped shape me.
            </p>

                <h3>President of the United States</h3>
                <h4>2020-2024</h4>
                <p>
                    Serving as the 47th President of the United States, my time in office was full of political
                    turbulence.
                    One of the greatest challenges I faced was debating Donald Trump and countering his endless barrage
                    of
                    conspiracy theories and lies. Despite the obstacles, I maintained composure and led the country
                    through
                    some of its most trying times, all while setting new standards for leadership.

                <h3>Astronaut – First Woman on the Moon in Louboutins</h3>
                <h4>2020</h4>
                <p>
                    As an astronaut, I became the first woman to land on the moon, and I did so with style, donning a
                    pair
                    of Louboutins during the historic walk. Balancing high fashion and space exploration wasn’t easy,
                    but it
                    was an iconic moment for both science and fashion. NASA still talks about the “red soles on the
                    moon”
                    moment to this day! While all the peasants were on lockdown, I was in space.

                <h3>Professional Pineapple Pizza Advocate</h3>
                <h4>2022-present</h4>
                <p>
                    My most recent role is possibly the most divisive – promoting pineapple as a valid pizza topping.
                    I’ve
                    traveled the world defending this controversial stance, delivering speeches at food festivals,
                    debating
                    world-class chefs, and organizing pineapple pizza pop-up events. My advocacy has made waves in the
                    culinary world, and although balancing presidency and pineapple advocacy was a difficult task, it
                    sparked debates that are still unresolved.
