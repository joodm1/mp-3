                <p>
                    While studying Computer Science at Boston University, my education here
                    has encompassed more than just computer science. Here are some of the courses I have taken in both
                    computer science and non-computer science fields.
                </p>

                    <h3>Computer Science Courses</h3>

                    <h4>CS210: Computer Systems</h4>
                    <p>
                        An introductory course in computer science where we learned how software and hardware interact
                        within a computer. We used various programming languages and ended the course by creating a
                        calculator in C.
                    </p>

                    <h4>CS237: Probability in Computation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This course covered probability concepts with an MIT Ph.D. professor, featuring MIT-style
                        problem
                        sets. It was a really fun course that I wish I could take again to be more present and engaged.
                    </p>

                    <h4>CS350: Distributed Systems</h4>
                    <p>
                        A course focused on networks of independent computers that work together to achieve a common
                        goal.
                        This was the most interesting course I have taken, and it guides my interest in computer science
                        and
                        future career path. I would love to take it again with Professor Liagouris.

                    <h3>Non-Computer Science Courses</h3>

                    <h4>RN103: Asian Religions</h4>
                    <p>
                        This course explored Asian religions, encompassing diverse spiritual traditions such as
                        Hinduism,
                        Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto. We studied various cultures, and
                        the
                        knowledge gained helped me connect with more people on campus and in daily life.
                    </p>

                    <h4>AN234: Evolutionary Psychology</h4>
                    <p>
                        A course in evolutionary psychology that examines how human behavior, thoughts, and emotions are
                        shaped by evolutionary processes. It seeks to understand the adaptive functions of psychological
                        traits and their evolution in solving problems related to survival and reproduction. This course
                        also helped me with daily decision-making, connecting with people, and becoming more
                        sympathetic.
